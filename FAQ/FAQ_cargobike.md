## Check-in

These are the checks you always need to do before starting the trip !

1. Check if there is enough battery. Check if you have the two locks, the board computer and the keys.
2. Load the cases on the bike so that they fit well, attach with the belt. ! **Be carefull to bend through your knees, don't hurt your back !**
3. Start driving the bike with the front wheel straight. Drive safely !

*Note : Be sure to know where you go before the trip, otherwhise you lose a lot of time. Avoid steep roads or cobblestones. *

## Check-out

4. Lock the bike with two locks, one for the front wheel, one for the back wheel and the frame. Be sure to attach it to a solid object (traffic pole, bike stand, etc)
5. If you need to leave the modules with the material, be sure that they safely stored. You can lock them with the chaine lock or you can put them in a locked room.
6. Be proud of yourself, you did it ;)

Note : Let us know if there is anything special that happened, thanks !
