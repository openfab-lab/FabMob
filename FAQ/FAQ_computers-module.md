### How to log in ?
Mot de passe
c'est le même mot de passe qu'au OpenFab.
```
OR for some and in the futur. 
There will be a Fabmob guest session whith limited admin rights. With no password. 
```

### TinkerCAD login

Got to www.tinkercad.com and log in with the following login
login : fabmob1@ciklic.be
pass : fabmob1!
Replace the number 1 with the pc number.

**If the login doesn't work, please not it in the logbook !**

### What if the computer doesn't start up ?
Push the on/off button for 14 seconds then push it one more time. This should reboot the computer.

If this doesn't work, plug the computer for 10 min at the power and try again. **If the computer doens't start at all, note int in the logbook !**

The problem of starting up is less frequent when the computer in not put in hibride mode ie the screen closed. Avoid closing the screen without shutting down the computer.
