## Check-in
These are the checks you always need to do before starting the workshop !

1. Check if all the material is there. Look at [What is inside ?](https://github.com/openfab-lab/FabMob/blob/master/FAQ/FAQ_laser_module.md#what-is-inside-)
2. Set up all the material safely. Protect the table !
3. **Put on some protection glasses.**
4. Perform a first test. Don't forget to put the laser on as last. 

*Note : if you want to share the drawings with the participants of the workshop, then collect the models at the end of the workshop, before shutting down the computers.*

## Check-out
5. Check if all the material is back. It is important to check if all the material is well packed in the cases. 

**Note : if you remarked anything special, please note it in the logbook !**

### What are the laser settings ?
You can find the Laserweb workspace on the desktop. It has the recommended settings encoded.

Laser paper 150g

100% 2500mm/min
unclear line

100% 2000mm/min
fine line

100% 1500mm/min
fine uniform line, not cutting through

100% 1000mm/min
nicely through

100% 500mm/min
too much power


### What if the laser won't connect ?
Pay attention to put the laser on as last step. **Otherwise the laser will activated without asking.** 

Try the following sequence :

1. Connect the USB cable
2. Open the software LaserWeb 
3. Connect
4. **Power the printer on**

If the laser still doesn't connect then unplug the power cable and wait for 5min. It is possible that a static charge prevents the connection. 

### How to put the focal right ? 

The focal is the distance of the laser head to the material. This distance makes the laser sharp so it can be more precise and powerfull. 

The focal is set to 3mm from the table. If you the material you want to engrave is 3mm, you don't need to do anything but protecting the table. If the material is less than 3mm, than you need to place it on a piece so that the top of the material is at 3mm.

### What if the laser won't activate ?
If the laser doesn't activate, it can be for two reasons. One is that the laser tester is still on. You can see this if the red led on teh laser head is blinking. Push the little white button to put it off.

Alother reason is that you put the laser power too low. The minimum laser power is 20%.
