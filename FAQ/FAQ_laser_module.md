### What if the laser won't connect ?
Try the following sequence :

1. Connect the USB cable
2. Open the software LaserWeb 
3. Connect
4. Power the printer on

If the laser still doesn't connect then unplug the power cable and wait for 5min. It is possible that a static charge prevents the connection. 

### How to put the focal right ? 

The focal is the distance of the laser head to the material. This distance makes the laser sharp so it can be more precise and powerfull. 

The focal is set to 3mm from the table. If you the material you want to engrave is 3mm, you don't need to do anything but protecting the table. If the material is less than 3mm, than you need to place it on a piece so that the top of the material is at 3mm.

### What if the laser won't activate ?
If the laser doesn't activate, it can be for two reasons. One is that the laser tester is still on. You can see this if the red led on teh laser head is blinking. Push the little white button to put it off.

Alother reason is that you put the laser power too low. The minimum laser power is 20%.
