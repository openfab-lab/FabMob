## 3D design with TinkerCAD

### Goal of the workshop
- The young people get to learn the universe of the fablabs
- They create a 3D model that they can edit later on

### Flow of the workshop
h-2.5 Introduction of the workshop and presentation of the Mobile Fablab project
- Inform about the planning of the day, get to know the class and introduce yourselves as animators. Be clear that there will be no 3D printing of their desing today.
- Present the Mobile Fablab Project (see ppt on Google Drive). Tell them about the nearest Fablab.

h-2 Preparing the computers and discovering the 3D printer in little groups 
- Prepare the computers and ask to make groups of 2. Log the participants on the TinkerCAD accounts(www.tinkercad.com) (see [FAQ_computers-module](https://github.com/openfab-lab/FabMob/blob/master/FAQ/FAQ_computers-module.md#tinkercad-login))
- Demonstrate the 3D printing with the Fabrikator 3D printer and MatterControl (see [FAQ_3Dprinting-module]https://github.com/openfab-lab/FabMob/blob/master/FAQ/FAQ_3Dprinting-module.md#how-to-start-a-3d-print-))

h-1.5 Discovering TinkerCAD and introducing the contest
- Show one action at a time and asking to repeat. Ask what they can observe.
- Introduce the contest and tell which prize there is to win (usually this is the demo 3D printed object). Tell them about the Fablab Cheques.

h-1 Creating the 3D model and discovering more options of TinkerCAD
- Go around and ask every group how it is going. 
- Show other options of TinkerCAD and let them repeat the action.

h-0.5 Voting for the winner and closing the workshop
- Announce the end of the creation part 5min on beforehand. Stop everyone and value every creation with the group (applaud for exemple).
- Vote for the winner and hand over the price. Don't forget to put the real names of the young people for the design. End the session by clicking on the TinkerCAD icon on top to the left.
- Ask what the young people tought of the workshop. Hand over the Fablab Cheques.

h0 Thanking for their participation

After the workshop.
- log on every account and Tinker the designs of the participants. Click in the menu to the right on SEND TO and download the image of the design. Also scroll down and click INVITE PEOPLE and copy the link in an email to the school. Share the images and the links to the school via a file sharing program.

Thank you for making this happen !
